This module helps in debugging HTML::Template-based programs.  Testing 
the output of your programs is as easy as walking a hash.  Note that it 
will only test the variables set in the template, not the design of the 
page.  For that, you really need to use human.pl, a throughly excelent 
peice of software that has been stable for many, many years.

The prefered installation method is to use Module::Build:

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

A Makefile.PL is also included for backwards compatibility, and is 
thus installable using the old-school method:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Note that Module::Build needs to be installed in either case.
